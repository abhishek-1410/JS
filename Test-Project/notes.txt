** Js (Dynamically typed - no need to define data types) 

** let and const (must to define variables)

** Both for..of and for..in statements iterate over lists; the values iterated on are different though, for..in returns a list of keys on the object 
being iterated, whereas for..of returns a list of values of the numeric properties of the object being iterated.

** == in JavaScript is used for comparing two variables, but it ignores the datatype of variable. === is used for comparing two variables, but this 
operator also checks datatype and compares two values. Checks the equality of two operands without considering their type. Compares equality of 
two operands with their types.

** A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.

** One such technique is using higher order functions. Higher order functions are functions that take one or more functions as arguments, or return 
a function as their result.
arr.forEach((num) => {console.log(num*num);})  This one is HOF (forEach taking another function as input).

** The window object represents open window in the browser . It's not a JavaScript object it's browser's object which browser creates automatically
for us . It's a global object .
